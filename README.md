# Thesis Algorithms

An implementation for the algorithms I studied for my Bachelor of Science Thesis
on Computer Science.

## Tree Isomorphism Algorithm

Algorithm to determine if two arbitrary trees are isomorphic in O(n) time and
space.

## Doubly Lexical Ordering

A doubly lexical ordering of matrix is an ordering of the rows and columns of
the matrix so that the rows, as vectors, are lexically increasing and the
columns, as vectors, are lexically increasing. The lexical ordering of vectors
is the standard dictionary ordering (often called "lexicographic").  Given a
(0,1)-matrix M of size n x n, the algorithm runs in time O(n^2 log n) and space
O(n^2).
